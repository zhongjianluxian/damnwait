========
From the pronunciation it sounds like an app for dmv, and *yes it is*. This app can provide real-time and statistical data of the wait times of DMV locations, so that you can choose the best time slot. This is espacially useful when no appointment is made in advance.



Offering:
---------
Two types of data will be provided:

 1. real time wait time of dmv locations
 2. accumulative wait time of each weekdays (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc)

For these two options, user can choose the data-gathering start time.
>`e.g.` wait time of the past three days, wait time on Monday of the past one year
